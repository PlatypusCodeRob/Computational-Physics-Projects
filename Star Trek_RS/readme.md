Star Trek is about the dynamics of a three-body-system with one negligible mass, for example Earth, the Moon and a spacecraft. 
The general hamiltonian for this system is split to make it easier to find equations of motion. ("Hamiltonian Splitting"). 
The respective solutions for given starting parameters are approximated numerically by advancing the equations of motion by small timesteps. Conservation of energy holds to a degree that is dependent on the timestep.
